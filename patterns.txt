Useful patterns and shortcuts that can be used

1.  Sliding Window
    When :  we need to handle input in a fixed window size
    DS: Array, String, hashtable
    Example : Longest subsctring with K distinct character

2. Fast and slow pointer
   When : To check the length or the linkedList and to check if there is a cycle exist in linkedlist of array
   DS : Linked List or Array
   Example : https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/

3. Trees 
   Most of the times Tree problems can be done by using recursive approach. In recursive solutions most of the times the base case is "if not root: return". 
   For DFS : Use stack
   For BFS : Use queue
